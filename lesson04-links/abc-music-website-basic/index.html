<!--
    At this level, we became more familiar in writing the HTML5 template (boilerplate)
    So instead of typing it completely,
    we can the hotkeys in VS Code to generate the full HTML5 template

    Two different Hotkeys:
    1) typing html:5 then press Enter key
    2) press (SHIFT + 1) == to get this symbol ! ==> press Enter key
 -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--
        the following line of "http-equiv":
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        is being generated by VScode
        it's NOT considered to be one of the required meta element.

        Because VScode Editor is built by Microsoft
        and IE and Edge web browsers are also built by Microsoft

        that's why Microsoft tries to add this line for fixing
        the compatibility issues with the old browser Internet Explorer (IE)

        so this line is dedicated for users who still using IE browsers
     -->
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

    <!--
        the meta element of "viewport":
        this line is required when we create a responsive website
        so it's for RWD (Responsive Web Design) Only
        We will use this line of code and it will explained in details with "Media Queries"
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Welcome to ABC Music</title>

    <!--
        We worked on "Absolute URL"
        which is a link to other website
        example:
        <a href="htttp://canadianbusinesscollege.com">

        We worked on links within the same page or same website but a section in page
        So it's a link to a full page, it's link to an element within an HTML page
        using "id" attribute
        example:
        "#" is the symbol for id and "main" is the id name
        <a href="#main">
        -->

    <!--
        In this file we will work on "Relative URL"
        which is a link to another page within the same website
        Each website has the main navigation
        We can create this navigation by using a list with hyperlinks:
        <ul>
            <li> ==> <a>
        -->

    <!--
            Very Important Note:
            When we create a plain html website:
            The home page for any website should be index.html by default

            if the home page file has another name other than index.html
            like: "home.html"
            the user has to type:
            www.website-name.com/home.html => to open the home page

            if the home page is "index.html"
            the user has to type:
            www.website-name.com => to open the home page
         -->
    <ul>
        <!-- Relative URL: we don't put http with the website domain -->
        <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="about.html">About Us</a></li>
        <li><a href="music.html">Our Music</a></li>
        <li><a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h1>ABC Music</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our website!</p>
