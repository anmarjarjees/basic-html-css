    <title>Lesson4 Links: Absolute Links</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h2>Working with links</h2>
    <p>In this chapter we are going to practice the 4 types of links:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Linking to Other Sites (Absolute URL):</dt>
        <dd>
            When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full web address for the
            site, which is know as an absolute URL.
        </dd>

        <dt>Linking to Other pages on the Same Site (Relative URL):</dt>
        <dd>
            When you link to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL.
            You can use a shorthand known as relative URL.
        </dd>

        <dt>Email Links:</dt>
        <dd>
            When you link to the userâ€™s email program. The value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is
            followed by the email address of the recipient.
        </dd>

        <dt>Linking to Fragment Identifiers (to a Specific Part of the Same Page or Another Page):</dt>
        <dd>
            To link to an element that uses an id attribute, so the value of the href attribute starts with the "hash
            mark" # symbol
            followed by the value of the id attribute of the element you want to link to.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</h3>
    <p>A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), colloquially termed a web address, is a reference to a web resource that
        specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.</p>

    <p>
        We have two types of links, <em>"absolute link"</em> and <em>"relative link"</em>. Absolute link is for linking
        to another website while relative link is for linking to another page on the same website or to other part
        (section) within the same page. In relative links, we don't use the full URL address, we just need to specify
        the file name with its full local path if needed.
    </p>

    <!--
        Absolute link ==> the full URL
        example: https//www.facebook.com

        URL: stands for Uniform Resource Locator.
    -->


    <!--
        using <a> and </a> to add anchor tag
        <a> element is used for adding Hyperlinks

        - to add a link means to add a hyperlink by using <a> element,
        - the <a> stands for anchor element,
        - we need to add  an anchor tag to make the <a> element functional
        - we can convert any element to be a hyperlink element if you want just by enclosing (wrapping) it with <a> element.
        - <a> element has opening and closing tags: <a>My Content</a>

        examples:
        - href="https://canadianbusinesscollege.com"
        OR:
        - href="https://canadianbusinesscollege.com/"

        All browsers have a set of default styles:
        By default, any link will be:
        - in blue colour
        - underlined
        but we learn how to change these two default style by using CSS.

        NOTE:
        After visiting the link (click it) the colour will be purple (by default)
        but we can also change with our custom CSS

        -----------------------------------
        The <a> element has two attributes:
        -----------------------------------
        Attributes:
        Just to recap, attributes are the extra needed information that we can add/write within the opening tags. Some Attributes are mandatory while other attributes are optional. We cannot add attributes to the closing tags!

        1) href attribute (mandatory):
        - to make <a> element active (work): we must add its required attribute "href" which is short for "hyperlink reference"
        - href is used to tell the link where to go?
        href="?"
        href: is the attribute name
        "?": is the attribute value which is the URL (the target address)

        2) target attribute (optional):
        also we can add another optional attribute "target" to specify whether you want to open the link within the same tab (over the current page) or in a separate new tab within the same browser window (this is the default)

        Example: To open the link in a new tab: target="_blank"

        The link could be the destination (address):
        1- Page within the same website ==> [Relative URL]
        2- Another Website ==> [Absolute URL] ==> The full address (URL)
        Example for Absolute URL: http://www.w3schools.com
        or https:// ==> s for secured connection (depends on the website)
        3- Content within the same page [Using id attribute]
    -->

    <!-- We will start with "Absolute Link" as it's very straight froward-->
    <h2>Absolute Link Example</h2>
    <!--
        Task:
        convert the text "W3Schools" in this paragraph
        to make a link to open the home page of this website

        the href value should be the URL for "W3Schools"

        HINT:
        it's better to open the home page of this website
        and just copy and paste the link into the href attribute value
        which is "https://www.w3schools.com/"
     -->
    <p>
        We are studying HTML5, and in this lesson, we are going to work with links. You can visit
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> to
        learn more about HTML5 and other important subjects
    </p>

    <!--
        Task: Add an absolute URL link for "Canadian Business College"         

        Be carful that not all websites have https:// (secured connection)
        many of them have just http:// (no "s" => not secured)

        if the website doesn't provide a secured connection, so don't put https:// just put http:// in the absolute URL.

        So it's better to copy the address instead of trying to type it
