        We need to give each link a unique identifire "id"
        by giving them a unique name using the "id" attribute
        example:
        id="main"

        in HTML the "id" attribute's value has the # symbol
        so to refer the id="main" we need to write #main

        attribue: is the extra info inside the opening element
        attributeName = "attributeValue"
        example:
        <a href="index.html">
        href ==> attribute name
        "index.html" ==> attribute value
