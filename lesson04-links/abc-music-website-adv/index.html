<!-- 
    At this level, we became more familiar in writing the HTML5 template (boilerplate)
    So instead of typing it completely, 
    we can the hotkeys in VS Code to generate the full HTML5 template

    Two different Hotkeys:
    1) typing html:5 then press Enter key
    2) press (SHIFT + 1) == to get this symbol ! ==> press Enter key

         the following line of "http-equiv":
         <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
         is being generated by VScode
         it's considered to be one of the required meta element.
         
         Because VScode Editor is built by Microsoft
         and IE and Edge web browsers are also built by Microsoft
 
         that's why Microsoft tries to add this line for fixing 
         the compatibility issues with the old browser Internet Explorer (IE)
 
         so this line is dedicated for users who still using IE browsers
      -->
