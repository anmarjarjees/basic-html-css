        div wrapper will be the main div to contain our entire code (HTML elements)

     Review:
     We have two attributes to name/lable any element:
     - id
     - class
     - # is the id symbol (we used this symbol # with hyperlinks and will be used in CSS)
     - . is the class symbol (the dot symbol will be used in CSS)

    div#wrapper ==> a div element that has id="wrapper"
    div.wrapper ==> a div element that has class="wrapper"
    -->
    <div class="wrapper">
        <!-- 
            - Action attribute tells the browser where it should submit the form. 
            will be "the file" on the server (localhost server in our examples) to handle the form request. 
            This file is written in a programming language like:
            - PHP (the popular web programming language)
            - Python
            - Ruby
            - C#
            - JAVA
            - etc…

    
            - Method attribute tells the browser which HTTP method it should use to submit the form.
            method="get" or method="post"
            two main (common) types of methods that are used by PHP when we submit the form:

            - get: (the default if you don’t specify)
            * method="get" or method="GET" (The Default)
            * is less secured (the info will be attached to the URL) because the data is appended to the URI
            * can handle few data (simple forms)
            * doesn't support file upload feature
            * is usually used for the search form only

            - post:
            * method="post" or method="POST"
            * is more secured (the info will be imbedded with the page) because the data are included in the body of the form
            * can handle large amount of data (simple to more complex forms)
            * supports file upload feature
            * is used for contact us form, registration form, login from etc. (except search form)
        -->
        <form action="result.html" method="post">
            <!--
            with HTML5 we can classify our form into different sections
            using "fieldset" element.

            <fieldset> for grouping related form controls together.

            like below we are grouping the contact details and the personal information of the same person 
            inside fieldset.
            
            fieldest has a child element named <legend> to give a title for this group (fieldset)
            we can divide all the form contents into several fieldset elements
            -->
            <fieldset>
                <legend>Contact and Personal Details</legend>

                    A labels for attribute has the same name as a inputs id.
                    Each labels "for" should have the same value as 
                    its corresponding inputs id -->
                    <!-- The most commonly used way -->
                    <label for="first-name">First Name:*</label>
                    <br>
                    <!-- 
                    id="first-name":
                    - to connect it with its label using for attribute
                    - can be used to give this input element a unique style (CSS)
                    - can be used with JS or jQuery to target this element

                    name="first-name":
                    - To be used by the back-end developer with sever-side language
                    to get the value of this field
                    - can be used by CSS to style this element
                    - can be used by JS to target this element

                    we can use required = "required" for the old versions
                    or we can just use required for HTML5

                    the classical way: required="required"
                    OR:
                    the new HTML5 way: required

                    maxlength ==> maximum number of characters

                    we will use size="30" to change the input width.
                    instead of using size attribute we need to use CSS, size="30" is an OLD WAY (but still valid), 
                    we will use CSS to style the width (better)

                    every input field must have the name attribute
                -->
                    <input type="text" id="first-name" name="first-name" required maxlength="30" size="30">
                </div>

                <div>
                    <!-- But we can also place the input element to be a child of label element
                and we don't have to use for attribute -->
                    <label>Last Name:*
                        <br>
                        <!-- use the value attribute for default input values => value="Simpsons" -->
                        <input type="text" id="last-name" required maxlength="30" size="30">
                    </label>
                </div>
                <!-- 
            Before HTML5 we used to have only: type="text" 
            and it's still valid (no errors in validation)

            HTML5:
            type="text" is the default one
            Notice that all the below new listed attributes belong to HTML5:
            type="email" ==> to write an email address
            type="url" ==> to write a website address
            type="tel" ==> to write a telephone number
            type="date" ==> to write/insert the date (Calendar Icon)
            type="number" ==> to put numbers only (Positive or negative)

            But with HTML5 we should use type="email" for these two main reasons:
            - To have an email validation automatically and instantly (has to have @ and the . symbols)
            - For the mobile users, so the keypad will be changed to show them the @ and .com for example  

            All the above new types work only with the modern and updated browsers that support HTML5. If the user opening a website with an old version browser (doesn’t support HTML5) they will be simply changed to type="text" as it used to be before HTML5

                        <!-- 
                any browser that supports HTML5 will validate the email
                the pattern must be anyText@anyText.anyText

                With HTML5, we can also add the new attribute placeholder
             -->
                        <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="name@example.com" maxlength="40" size="30">

                    Note: using placeholder with type="date" will give us error in validation
                    By default we will have the placeholder as: YYYY-MM-DD because of type="date" 
                    so it will be always fixed format based on our windows date and time settings. 
                    With Google Chrome, size="30" has no effect on input of type="date"

                        Note:
                        If the user needs to upload a file,
                        the form "method" value has to be "POST" NOT "GET"
                        because with GET method, we can't upload/send a file to the server
                    -->
                    <input type="file" name="resume">
                </div>
            </fieldset>

            <!-- 
                    At the end of the form we need to have 
                    the submit option

                    the most commonly used way (Better):
                -->
            <input type="submit" value="Register" name="register">
            <!-- 
                We can put an image inside the submit 
                using type="image" with src="imageFileName.jpg" this becam old fashion
                -->
            <input type="image" src="images/subscribe.jpg" alt="subscribe icon" name="register">
            <!--  
                instead of using input of type="submit"
                we can use the <button> element to submit the form
                but DON'T use both at the same time or at the same form
    
                Here we are using both just for testing
            -->
            <br>
            <br>

            <button>
                <img src="images/add.gif" alt="add"> Submit
            </button>

            <!-- To clear all the form fields: -->
            <input type="reset" name="reset" value="Clear">
        </form>
    </div>

</body>
