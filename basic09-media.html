    <!-- 
         it's a good idea to create a div
         with an id or a class attribute 
         to contain all page content.
        
         so it will easy for us in the future 
         to center the page content using csss 
    -->
    <div id="wrapper">
        <!-- 
            .mp4 is the new format for internet videos
            - used by YouTube
            - used by Flash Players
            - supported by HTML5

            using <video> element to insert the video

            IE, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera
            can support the MP4 video format

            Besides .mp4 we have the other video formats which are: 
            - WebM: Chrome, Firefox, Opera
            - Ogg: Chrome, Firefox, Opera

            Note that "IE" and "Safari" don't support .WebM and .Ogg
         -->

        <!-- 
            <video> is NOT an empty element
            all video's elements will be as attributes in the opening tag
            attName="attValue"
            in HTML5 some attributes don't have values because their name 
            is descriptive and they can only do one thing:

            so instead of typing: autoplay="autoplay" as we usually do
            we can just type autoplay
         -->
        <video src="media/puppy.mp4" poster="images/puppy.jpg" controls autoplay loop muted width="800"></video>

        <!-- 
        The other way of loading a video file is using the format sources, so if you want to load more than one format we need to use the source element with src attribute in w3 schools website: 
        we can apply the same attributes exactly as the top video element 
        -->
        <video>
            <!-- the format that is supported by the browser will be loaded: -->
            <source src="media/puppy.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            <source src="media/puppy.WebM" type="video/WebM">
            <source src="media/puppy.ogg" type="video/ogg">
            <!-- 
            if the browser is very old (IE 8) and doesn't support the new HTML5 video element 
            the following text will appear 
            -->
            <p>Your browser does not support the HTML5 video element</p>
        </video>


        <!-- 
            Same rules for <video> element are applied for <audio> element
            The three supported audio formats:
            - mp3: used by all browsers
            - wav: all browsers except IE
            - ogg: Chrome, Firefox, and Opera (except IE and Safari)    
            To learn more about video and audio:
