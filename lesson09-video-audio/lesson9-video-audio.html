it's a good idea to create a div with an id or a class attribute to contain all page content.
It will easy for us in the future to center the page content using CSS

            .mp4 is the new format for internet videos
            - used by YouTube
            - used by Flash Players
            - supported by HTML5

            using <video> element to insert the video
            NOTE: video is an inline element

            You can read more: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp

            IE (MS Edge), Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera
            can support the MP4 video format

            Besides .mp4 we have the other video formats which are:
            - WebM: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Edge
            - Ogg: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge

            Note that:
            - "IE" and "Safari" don't support .Ogg format
            - "IE" doesn't support WebM format also
            *   *   *   *   *   *   *


            <video> is NOT an empty element => It has opening/start and closing/end tags

            all video's elements will be as attributes in the opening tag only
            attName="attValue"

            As we have learnt before, in HTML5 some attributes don't have values because their name
            is descriptive and they can only do one thing:

            Examples:
            - we can just write required instead or required="required"
            - we can just write checked instead or checked="required"

            The video file "puppy.mp4" is from our textbook

            so instead of typing: autoplay="autoplay" as we usually do
            we can just type autoplay

            notice these attribute, don't have a values:
            - controls
            - preload
            - muted
            - autoplay

            We and add width and height if needed (optionals)


            The "preload" attribute: <video preload="auto|metadata|none">
            It specifies how the author thinks that the video should be loaded when the page loads.

            The preload attribute allows the author to provide a hint to the browser
            about what he/she thinks will lead to the best user experience.
            This attribute may be ignored in some instances.

            Note: The preload attribute is ignored if autoplay is present.

            Auto => The author thinks that the browser should load the entire video when the page loads
            Metadata => The author thinks that the browser should load only metadata when the page loads
            None => The author thinks that the browser should NOT load the video when the page loads
            *   *   *   *   *   *   *

            Based on MDN Docs:
            the attribute "preload":
            This enumerated attribute is intended to provide a hint to the browser about what the author thinks will lead to the best user experience with regards to what content is loaded before the video is played.

            It may have one of the following values:
            none: Indicates that the video should not be preloaded.
            metadata: Indicates that only video metadata (e.g. length) is fetched.
            auto: Indicates that the whole video file can be downloaded, even if the user is not expected to use it.
            empty string: Synonym of the auto value.
            The default value is different for each browser. The spec advises it to be set to metadata.

                if the browser is very old (IE 8) and doesn't support the new HTML5 video element
                the following text will appear.

                We will not be able to see this paragraph => we all use the recent versions of the browsers
            -->
            <p>Sorry, your browser does not support the HTML5 video element!</p>
        </video>

        <!--
        The other way of loading a video file is using the format sources,
        so if you want to load more than one format,
        we need to use the <source> "empty" element with src attribute in w3 schools website:
        we can apply the same attributes exactly as the top video element

        Notice that the "video" element can have all the same attribute as the above example
        except the "src" attribute, it's replaced with <source> element

        NOTE:
        Chrome will not activate/use the attribute "autoplay" if there is NO "muted" attribute!
        Chrome will only auto play the video with "autoplay" attribute if there is "muted" attribute
        Why? To protect the user privacy and keep us away from any embarrassing situation :-)

        <!--
            same rules for <video> element are applied for <audio> element

            The three supported audio formats:
