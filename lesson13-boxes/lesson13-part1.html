            padding: value1 value2
            value1: Top/bottom padding
            value2: Left/Right padding


            padding: value1

                below we have 5px margin,

                If the margin property has three values:
                margin: 25px 50px 75px;
                top margin is 25px
                right and left margins are 50px
                bottom margin is 75px

        Two elements (div1 and div2)
        div1 above div2
        - div1 has a bottom margin of 20px
        - div2 has a top margin of 10px;
        We might think => The browser will put 30px margin in between then (Wrong)
        The browser will look at the largest value which is 20px
        so the browse wil add only 20px

            <p>The Fender Mustang was introduced in 1964 as the basis of a major redesign of Fender's student models
                then consisting of the Music master and Duo-Sonic. It was originally popular in sixties surf music and
                attained cult status in the 1990s largely as a result of its use by a number of alternative rock bands.
