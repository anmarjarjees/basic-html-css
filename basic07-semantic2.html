            - Use this element at the top of your page or within page sub sections

            one heading tag (<h1> – <h6>).

            The <main> element can be used only once per page. 
            It contains the main content of the page outside of the page-level heading and footer.
            - It should not have content that is repeated across the pages,
             such as; links, logo, copyright.
            - It should only have material that is unique to the current page.

                - The <section> element is used to represent a group of related content. 
                - A section is similar to the purpose of an <article> element with the main difference being 
                  that the content within a <section> element doesn’t necessarily need to make sense out of the context of the page.

                <!-- 
                    - The <article> element represents an independent piece of content. 
                    - That is content that makes sense on its own. 
                    - An article could be a blog post, a magazine or newspaper article, a user-submitted comment, 
                      an interactive widget, or any other independent item of content

            - But in addition to navigation elements, 
            - a footer typically contains information about each section such as who wrote it,
            links to related documents, copyright data, and the like.
