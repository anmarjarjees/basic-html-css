        <h2>HTML Form Structure</h2>
        <!--
    A form is an HTML element that contains and organizes object called "From Controls".
    From Controls are the objects that accept the information

    NOTE:
    There can be multiple forms on a web page,
    but they CANNOT be nested inside each other.

    HTML <form> element: has the opening and closing tags =><form></form>

    Like many other html elements, form elements come with required/optional attributes and some of them are new for HTML5 (not previous versions):
    
    - action (required)
    - method (optional) => has a default (initial) value of "get" (explained below)
    - autocomplete (HTML5 attribute-optional) => is the default value is "on", 
    browser will use autocompletion to fill form filed.
    You can set its value to "off" if you don't want to disable this feature
    - id/class (optional) like any other element
    - name (optional) => naming the form to be easily accessed by client-side scripting if needed

    Generally, every form should/must have the following two main types of attributes:
    - action (should)
    - method (must)

    Action attribute:
    The value of this attribute will be "the file" or "The URL" on the server (localhost server in our PC)
    to handle the form request. This file is written in a programming language like:
    - PHP (the popular web programming language - our future module)
    - C#
    - JAVA
    - Python
    - etc…

    The syntax: action = "filename.extension"

    in PHP course we will learn:
    - how to write the php code
    - how to load the php file

    // examples: process.php or register.php are just example!

    
    Method attribute:
    two main (common) types of methods that are used by PHP/Python when we submit the form:
    1- get: (the default if you don't specify or if you don't add the method attribute)
    *a method="get" or method="GET" (The Default)
    *b is less secured (the info will be attached to the URL)
    *c can handle few data (simple forms)
    *d doesn't support file upload feature
    *e is usually used for the search form only (like in Google search or Bing search engines)
    2- post:
    *a method="post" or method="POST"
    *b is more secured (the info will be imbedded with the page)
    *c can handle large amount of data (simple to more complex forms)
    *d supports file upload feature
    *e is used for contact us form, registration form, login from etc. (except search form)
    -->

        <!--
    For learning HTML you can leave action attribute value empty,
    in such case the form will not be submitted to any other page
    so the send button function will be used just to refresh the page.

    Note:
    The following code will give us:
    "Error Page not found" because we are calling the file named "register.php" that doesn’t exists.
    This topic will be covered with me in PHP module
    when I start teaching you how to receive and retrieve all the from inputs.
    -->

        <!-- Start the form element: -->
        <form action="form.php" method="POST">
            <!--
          with HTML5 we can classify our form into different sections
          using "fieldset" element.

          <fieldset> for grouping related form controls
          together.

          like below we are grouping the contact and the personal
          details of the same person inside fieldset
        fieldset has a child element named <legend> to give a title for this group (fieldset)
        we can divide all the form contents into several fieldset elements
        -->
            <fieldset>
                <legend>Contact and Personal Details</legend>
                <!--
                    Form's elements are inline elements

                    We can use any block-level element to display the form fields in vertical way:
                    - div
                    - p
                    - ul and li
                    - br

                    div is a block level element
                    or use p element or you can use <br>
                    <span> is an inline element like <em> or <b>

                    Let's try to place every from element inside a div
                    - for better layout to be displayed in separate lines
                    - to style them later
                -->
                <div>
                    <!--
                    "label" element has "for" attribute
                    the value of this attribute has to be the same value
                    of the "id" attribute of its corresponding input filed .

                    Each label's "for" should have the same value as
                    its corresponding input's id
                    -->
                    <!-- The most commonly used way is using "for" with "label" -->
                    <label for="first-name">First Name:*</label><br>
                    <!--
                     Any form element must have the "type" attribute
                    type="????"

                    we can put type="text" (the default value of type attribute)
                    With HTML5 we can put type="email" or "url" or "number"

                    The "id" value it linked to the "for" value

                    id="first-name":
                    - to connect the input field with its label using for attribute
                    - can be used to give this input element a unique style (using CSS)
                    - can be used with JS or jQuery to target this element
                    - or it can be used with hyperlink!

                    name="first-name":
                    - *To be used by the back-end developer with a sever-side programming language
                    NOTE for Back-End Development:
                    In order to get the value of any input field,
                    every input field MUST have the name attribute

                    - can be used by CSS to style this element
                    - can be used by JS to target this element

                    required attribute: 
                    - a new attribute that has been introduced by HTML5
                    - this (input) field is required to have some values 
                    (CANNOT BE EMPTY WHEN YOU SUBMIT THE FORM!)

                    We can use required = "required" as the classical way
                    or we can just use the attribute value required

                    The classical way: required="required"
                    OR:
                    The other way: required

                    maxlength attribute:
                    maxlength ==> maximum number of characters (any character)
                    The user CANNOT go beyond the specific number of character

                    size attribute:
                    we will use size="30" to change the input field width.
                    instead of using size attribute we need to use CSS,
                    size="30" is an OLD WAY (but still valid),
                    we will use CSS to style the width (better)

                    Finally, we can use the HTML5 attribute "autofocus",
                    Browser places cursor in the form control and sets focus.
                    Syntax:
                    - autofocus
                    OR
                    - autofocus="autofocus"
                 -->
                    <input type="text" id="first-name" name="first-name" required maxlength="30" size="30" autofocus>
                </div>

                <!-- Adding another div element as a container for the last name -->
                <div>
                    <!--
                    Another way of using label with its input field:
                    we can also place the input element to be a child of its label element
                    and we don't have to use "for" attribute in this case
                    -->
                    <label>
                        Last Name:*<br>
                        <!--
                        Below we used  id="last-name" in case to be used with CSS or JS
                        You can use the value attribute for default input values => value="Simpsons"
                        -->
                        <input type="text" id="last-name" name="last-name" required maxlength="30" size="30">
                    </label>
                </div>
                <!--
                Before HTML5 we used to have only: type="text"
                and it's still valid (no errors in validation)
                type="text" is the default one (the classical type)

                HTML5 => Introduced os us other types that we can use:
                Notice that all the below new listed attributes belong to HTML5:
                type="email" ==> to write an email address
                type="url" ==> to write a website address
                type="tel" ==> to write a telephone number
                type="date" ==> to write/insert the date (Calendar Icon)
                type="number" ==> to put numbers only (Positive or negative)


                For example:
                Before HTML5, we used to write type="text" for the email address field
                But with HTML5 we should use type="email" for these two main reasons:
                1- To have an email validation automatically and instantly working by checking the text has the "@" symbol and the "."" symbol
                2- For the mobile users, so the keypad will be changed to show them the @ and .com for example

                Important Note:
                All the above new types work only with the modern and updated browsers that support HTML5.
                If the user opening a website with an old version browser (doesn't support HTML5)
                they will be simply changed to type="text" as it used to be before HTML5
                -->

                <!-- Adding another div element as a container for the email field -->
                <div>
                    <label>Email:*<br>
                        <!--
                        Notice any browser that supports HTML5 will validate the email field
                        the pattern must be anyText@anyText.anyText

                        With HTML5, we can also add the new attribute "placeholder"
                        -->
                        <input type="email" required name="email" placeholder="name@example.com" maxlength="40"
                            size="30">
                    </label>
                </div>

                    <!--
                        Radio Buttons:
                        1- At least one option (item) should be selected by default
                        2- User CANNOT select more than one (and only one) item

                        1) Solution: using "checked" attribute
                        checked = "checked" (HTML4 and XHTML)
                        OR just:
                        checked (for new browsers that support HTML5)

                        2) Solution: using "name" attribute, for two reasons:
                        reason#1:
                        to group all the related radio button items
                        so the user can only check/select on item

                        reason#2:
                        The one we discussed before which is to be used mainly for the backend development
                        in order for example "PHP/Python developers" to get the user values we use:
                        - name attribute: (the value of the name attribute) must be the same for all radio options in order to be treated as a group.


                        With radio button fields, we need to add "value" attribute
                        - value attribute:
                        a) has to be "unique" for each radio button option,
                        b) The value is not shown to the user, but it will be sent to the server when the form is submitted

                        Tip:
                        Always add the <label> tag for best accessibility practices!
                        As it will be explained why below with checkbox input fields

                        Notice that the id attribute is "optional" for the following input fields
                        because we don't have "for" attribute for the label
                     -->
                    <input type="radio" checked name="comptype" value="desk">Desktop<br>
                    <input type="radio" name="comptype" value="lap">Laptop<br>
                    <input type="radio" name="comptype" value="all">All-in-one<br>
                </div>

                <div>
                    What's your favourite music?
                    <br>
                    <!--
                        With checkbox, user can select one, all, or none

                        By default, the data sent to the server from a checkbox that is checked is the value of "on".
                        If you give the checkbox a value attribute,
                        the value you give this attribute is the value that will be sent to the server

                        NOTE:
                        It's not mandatory or required to use the same value for the name attribute
                        for all the checkbox options (like radio buttons)
                        depending on the following real-world situations:

                        if checkboxes are completely unrelated, then you can just deal with them all separately,
                        by giving each checkbox input a unique value for its "name" attribute.

                        if the checkboxes are all related so we should use the same value for all the "name" attributes
                        these values of the checked (selected) checkbox inputs will be sent to the server as a group of values
                        Back-end programmers can deal with it as list (array)

                        Using <label> element is important for two reasons:
                        ***************************************************
                        1- The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users,
                        the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element.
                        2- The <label> element also helps users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions
                        (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) especially on small screens,
                        when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox.

                        NOTE: We should always add the <label> tag for best accessibility practices
                    -->
