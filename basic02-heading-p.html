        Metadata â€“ is data that describes other data. 
        The HTML content that you see in a browser window is data. 
        But HTML can also contain metadata in its <head> element 
        that describes the stuff you see on the browser. 
        
        For example: 
        metadata can specify who wrote the document, 
        and provide a list of keywords and phrases used in the document.

        UTF: Unicode Transformation Format 
        UTF-8 (UCS Transformation Format 8) is the World Wide Web's most common 
        character encoding. Each character is represented by one to four bytes. 

        This ensures that you can use characters from just about any human language
        in your HTML document, and they will display reliably.
