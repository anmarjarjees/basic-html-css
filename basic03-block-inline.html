     HTML elements are usually either block-level elements or inline elements. 
     A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), 
     thereby creating a block. 
     Browsers typically display the block-level element with a new line both before 
     and after the element. 
     They have a rectangular structure (like a Box that has 4 borders)
