        image element has only one tag <img />. There is no content. 
        All elements have what are called attributes. 
        If the element consists of an opening and a closing tag, 
        the attributes are referred to in the opening tag. 
        Attributes are additional properties of an element. 
        In our image example listed in our code below, 
        you can see it uses a src attribute.

        <!--
        the content of the paragraph is 
        "Paragraph is element with opening and closing tag."
        and it will be shown on the web page
         -->
