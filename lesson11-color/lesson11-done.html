            Inline Styles:
            below is an example of applying an inline styles
            we use the attribute "style" so inline styles can be applied 
            as attributes for any HTML element:
            style="property: value; property: value; and so on...."
    
            Notice that inline styles will override the external and the internal styles because they are the closest ones to the elements
         
            inline styles: as an attribute for any HTML element
            style = " property: value; property: value; "
    
            Notice that we don't use { and } because there is no selector,
            our our selector is the current element itself
