        meta element:
        - is an empty element to describe data
        * Empty Element (Self-contained tag) => has only opening tag (no closing tag)
        - charset: character set
        - UTF: standard Unicode Transformation Format (UTF).

        UTF-8:
        - (UCS Transformation Format 8) is the World Wide Web's most common character encoding.
        - Each character is represented by one to four bytes.
        - UTF-8 is backward-compatible with ASCII and can represent any standard Unicode character.
        - UTF-8 can represent any character in the Unicode standard
        - UTF-8 is the preferred encoding for e-mail and web pages


        charset uses the code "UTF-8"
        This code support all the languages from different countries
        like Japan or china or middle-east (right to left)

        we use the empty element <meta> to describe or identify our data
        it's like information about information
        so we want here to describe the character set code is UTF-8
        we add:  <meta charset="utf-8">
