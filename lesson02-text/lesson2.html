    <!-- 
        We also have <p> element for paragraph: 
        Opening <p> tag and closing </p> tag 
        
        Notice that the heading and tex begin near hte left margin.
        This is called "Left Alignment" and is the default alignment for web pages.

        "align" attribute can be used to align the text with these values: left, right, center
        but this attribute is "Obsolete" in HTML5, 
        which means that this attribute has been used in XHTML,
        but  has been removed from W3C HTML5.

    <p>A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. The start of a paragraph is indicated by a new line.</p>

        Not all elements in HTML have opening and closing tags!
        We have few of them that only have opening tag (no closing). 
        These types of elements are considered to be "Stand-alone" tags 
        are also called "Empty Elements" or "Self-contained Tags"

        hr is for a horizontal ruler 
        br is for line break
        
        Example:
        <br> ==> Line break OR <br />
        <hr> ==> Horizontal Ruler OR <hr />
    -->


    <!-- 
	Below is the classical way (before HTML 5) which is the XHTML syntax,
    to write an empty element: "<" then "hr" then space then "/" then ">" 
	-->
    <hr />

    <!-- But with HTML5 we can ignore the space and / although it's still valid to put them -->
    <hr>

    <!-- 
        Phrase elements: also called "Logical Style Elements" indicate the context
        and meaning of the text between the container tags.
        
        Including:
        <abbr> - Abbreviation text
        <cite> - Citation text
        <b> - Bold text
        <strong> - Important text
        <i> - Italic text
        <em> - Emphasized text
        <mark> - Marked text
        <small> - Smaller text
        <sub> - Subscript text
        <sup> - Superscript text
        
        NOTE: 
        Although some element display the text in the same style/format/italic
        like <cite> and <em> display the text in "italic",
        but these tags/elements semantically describe the text as <cite> for citation
        and em for emphasis.

    <!-- 
        Two Types of Elements:
        - Block-Level Elements
        - Inline Elements

        wil be explained in details later
    -->

    <!-- 
        inline elements: can be embedded or inserted inside block elements
        examples:
        <i> for italic, <b> for bold, <em> for emphasis: are examples of inline elements
        <p>: is an example of block-level element
    -->
    <p>This word will be <b>bold</b>, this word will be <i>italic</i></p>

    <!-- 
		 <em> will make the text italic 
		 <i> will also make the text italic

		 <em> is important for other programs, like Screen Readers
		 or search engines can use this extra information

		 <sup> for superscript
		 <sub> for subscript

    For making up quotations
    using blockquote will indent the content 
    Browser tend to indent the contents of the <blockquote> element  
    -->
    <blockquote>
        "The browser will indent
        the content of blockquote element"

    <blockquote>
        "When there is a will, there is a way!" <em>unknown</em>

    <!-- br is for a line break -->
    <br>
    <!-- OR: -->
    <br />

    <!-- 
		using abbr element for abbreviations
		example:
		MS ==> Microsoft

		The extra info we add to the opening tag is called "attribute"
		attribute ==> attributeName = "attributeValue"
		example:
		title = "Microsoft"

		attributeName = title
		attributeValue = "Microsoft"

		so opening tag can have multiple attributes
