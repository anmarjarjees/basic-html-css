            <h2>Main Subjects</h2>
            <p>1. In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens
                faster:
                two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The
                device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device
                forward
                in a sort of gliding walk.
            </p>

            <p>2. The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when pedals were applied directly to
                the front wheel. This machine was known as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone
                shaker," since its wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an
                extremely
                uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could
                be found in large cities.
            </p>

            <p>3. The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood. This
                enjoyed
                a short lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any other place than a
                well
                maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.
            </p>

            <p class="clear">4. The front wheels became larger and larger as makers realized that the larger the
                wheel, the farther you
                could travel with one rotation of the pedals. For that reason, you would purchase a wheel as large as
                your leg length would allow. This machine was the first one to be called a bicycle ("two wheel"). These
                bicycles enjoyed a great popularity during the 1880s among young men of means. (They cost an average
                worker six month's pay.)
            </p>

            <p>5. Because the rider sat so high above the center of gravity, if the front wheel was stopped by a stone
                or
                rut in the road, or the sudden emergence of a dog, the entire apparatus rotated forward on its front
                axle and the rider, with his legs trapped under the handlebars, was dropped unceremoniously on his
                head.
                Thus the term "taking a header" came into being.
            </p>

            <p>6. Because the rider sat so high above the center of gravity, if the front wheel was stopped by a stone
                or
                rut in the road, or the sudden emergence of a dog, the entire apparatus rotated forward on its front
                axle and the rider, with his legs trapped under the handlebars, was dropped unceremoniously on his

            <p class="clear">7. Because the rider sat so high above the center of gravity, if the front wheel was
                stopped by a stone or
