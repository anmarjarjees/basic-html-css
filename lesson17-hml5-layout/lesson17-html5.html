        Since very old browsers like ie7 cannot understand

        To avoid this issue we need to convert them into "block" elements
        using the css rule "display: block"

        HTML5 offers new semantic elements to define different parts of a web page:
        •	<article>
        •	<aside>
        •	<details>
        •	<figcaption>
        •	<figure>
        •	<footer>
        •	<header>
        •	<main>
        •	<mark>
        •	<nav>
        •	<section>
        •	<summary>
        •	<time>

        IMPORTANT NOTES:
        - The HTML5 semantic elements are "Block Level" Elements
        - Please, be advised that Internet Explorer 11 and lower don't support HTML5 semantic elements
        which means they will be displayed as "Inline" Elements
        - We can use CSS to solve the issue with the inline display for old IE browsers
        - Yes, we can also convert these new block elements into inline elements using CSS if we like/want


     -->

    <!--
    div stands for division (section of the page)
    we can give it an "id" or "class" attribute
    we can give id or class a value like:
    - full-page
    - container
    - wrapper
    - or any name that makes sense to you since you are the developer

    notice that <div> is block level element

    If you don't want to use div as a block level element,
    you can use <span> which is an inline element that can be imbedded or inserted inside any element
    -->

    <!--
    we should never use section or article elements to layout the page content.
    in this case we need to use div element

    It's a good idea to have one main major div to contain all
    the elements of your webpage
    -->

    <!--
        Using section is not recommended <section id="container"></section>
        we need this div to layout our page and for CSS NOT for adding any semantic meaning

        <!--
        instead of typing:
        <div id="header">
        <div class="pageheader"> and etc..........
        we can just use HTML5 <header> element
        to refer to the main page header

        <header> element specifies
        a header for a document section (The main header)

            HTML5 <nav> element contains the major navigational block of the website

            <nav> contains the major
            navigational block such as the primary site navigation
            we can place the main navigation inside the <header> or after the <header>
            depending on how you like/prefer to style it

            NOTE:
            When any browser couldn't understand the element (not defined element)
            It will just treat it as an inline element:

            for fun, I put my initial to be an HTML element
            the browser will display the content in horizontal layout

                <p>
                    Any HTML element can have an id attribute, this id attribute is used to uniquely identify an
                    element on the page. The id symbol is <b>#</b>. "id" attribute can be used for linking to a
                    specific location within the same page or a location within another page, it can also be used in
                    styling rules, or by JavaScript code.
                </p>
                <p id="main-para" class="important-paragraph ">
                    id is used to uniquely identify an element from other elements on the page. You can write any
                    name for the id but without any spaces or special characters only "dash " or "underscore ".
                </p>

                <p>Please be advised that the name (the value) of the id can be used only for one time in the same
                    page.
                </p>

                <p class="important-paragraph ">
                    The attribute "id " can be used for linking to a specific location within the same page, or for
                    styling using "CSS ".
                </p>

            <article>
                <h2>Class Attribute</h2>
                <p>
                    Every HTML element can also have a class attribute, so it's also a global attribute like id.
                    Note like "id", class value can be used more than one time in the same page.
                </p>
                <p class="important-paragraph">
                    In case if you need to use the same name or the same value "important-paragraph " for more than
                    one time (for more than one paragraph), in such case we can use the other attribute named "class
                    ". class value can be used as many time as we need.
