<body>
    <!--   
        <div> stands for division (section of the page)
        <div> is a block-level element (block element)
        <div> like any other element, can have "id" or "class" attribute

        It's hard for us as developers to work with many div elements without labels!
        For this reason we can us either "id" or "class" attributes to label them

        The <div> below is for wrapping all the page elements 
        and that's why:
        - it starts directly after the opening body tag
        - and close(end) before the closing body tag

        Note:
        of you don't want to use div as a block level element,
        you can use <span> which is an inline element 
        that can be embedded or inserted inside any block element.

        We can have div inside another div and so on
     -->

    <!-- 
        this div is the main one to contain/wrap the entire page.
        "id" is used to uniquely identify an element from other elements on the  page.
        The value/name of the id can be any name 
        that makes sense to us as developer/designer
        
        Example:
        like below we can use:
        id="container"
        or 
        id="wrapper"
        or 
        id="page"
        
        to refer to the main major container of the page
      -->
    <div id="container">
        <!-- 
           This div is for the main page headings 

           let's try to use "class" attribute
            
            since this div is considered to be:
            - the main page header
            - or the header
            - or the head
            - or the heading
            
            so we can name it "header"

         -->
        <div class="header">
            <!-- We can put the page header: the site title, logo, navigation, etc-->
            <h1>Lesson8 Extra Markup</h1>
            <h2>More inline and block elements</h2>
        </div> <!-- end div.header -->

        <!-- 
            this div is for the "main" page content 

            let's label it with "content"
            we can use either id or class
        -->
        <div class="content">
            <!-- We can put the main articles of this page -->
            <h2>ID Attribute</h2>
            <!-- 
               <p> is a block element that can have inline elements like <b>
                Error:<em><p>Just for testing</p></em>
            -->
            <p>
                Any HTML element can have an id attribute, this id attribute is used to uniquely identify an element on
                the page. The id symbol is <b>#</b>. "id" attribute can be used for linking to a specific location
                within the same page or a location within another page, it can also be used in styling rules, or by
                JavaScript code.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Class Attribute</h2>
            <p>
                Every HTML element can also have a class attribute, so it's also a global attribute like id. Note like
                "id", class value can be used more than one time in the same page.
            </p>
            <!-- 
            Quick Review again: 
            div is a block level element like <p>,<ul>, <ol>, <li>, heading 1-6, etc..

            We also have inline elements, examples that we had in lesson 2 are the following elements that can insert inside any <p> element because they affect the text:
            - <i> for italic
            - <em> for emphasis
            - <b> for bold

            It's better to use CSS for adding these styles, and that's why we have another inline element that can be embedded inside any text or block element named "<span>"

            <span> </span>
            - We will use this <span> element to apply CSS Styles
            - We will use it also in our JavaScript module
            
            below is an example of using <div> as a block level element and span as inline element. For now <span> element has no visual effect because it has not styles! so using <span> by itself without styling or coding with JavaScript will be useless 
        -->
            <div>Here is my <span>first</span> line of simple text.</div>
            <div>Here is my <span>second</span> line of simple text.</div>

            <h2>Using iframe element</h2>
            <p>
                iframe element is like a little window that has been cut into your page!!! iframe can be used to place
                <em>google map code</em>, or can be used to place a <em>youtube vide code</em>.
            </p>
            <!-- 
            iframe is an inline element to have the two iframe elements 
            (google and youtube) appear in separate lines, we can use <br> or <hr> element, but we should do it using one from the following methods (ways):
            1. place them inside a <div> element since it's a block level element
            2. we can use CSS to convert inline element to become block element
            -->

            <!-- 
                src ==> the URL of the required page 

                Let's try to put the address of CBC

                <iframe src="??????Google Address?????????">

                </iframe>

                Old Note For Old Google Map Code*:  
                W3C Validator will give us this error about using frameborder
                Error: The "frameborder" attribute on the iframe element is obsolete. Use CSS instead.
                So we should remove this attribute (but we will leave it here just for learning)

                * Nowadays, google uses inline styles to add border:
                style="border:0;" <=> to be discussed with CSS lecture

                Google Map code uses width and height (They are valid)
                we should always use CSS instead of width and height attributes for RWD (Responsive Web Design)

                Adding and address from google to your webpage Steps:
                1.	Go to google to open the map address for any location 
                2.	Click "SHARE" on the left panel, the following window will appear
                3.	Click the "Embed a map" command:
                4.	Click "copy HTML"
                5.	Go to your webpage (your html file) then paste the code
