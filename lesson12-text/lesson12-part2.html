        /*
    Very Important Note:
    We still need to make sure that the listed new HTML5 block elements
    are being displayed as block elements in the very old browsers like IE8 and before,
    for that reason we will keep the following rule.
    you will do the same in your assignment2 and the project

    Remember that The second last part of chapter 17 (HTML5 Layout):
    We studied these elements:
    <header> <section> <article> <aside> <nav> <footer> <figure> <figcaption>

    Problem:
    All these elements suppose to be displayed as block elements,
    but old browsers can't display them as block elements
    because they can't recognize them! so they will displayed as inline elements

    Solution:
    to overcome this issue we will need to add the following CSS rule: display: block;
    so we can group them all into one selector to apply this style:
    */
        header,
        section,
        article,
        aside,
        nav,
        footer,
        figure,
        figcaption {
            display: block;
        }


        /*
        style any <h2> inside the <section>
        Descendant Selector
        */
        section h2 {
            color: brown;
        }

        /*
        To recap:
        - Pseudo Elements: acts like an extra element in the code:
        we focused on these two Pseudo Elements rules
        ::first-letter
        (The textbook [Released in 2011] uses one : but we should use :: now)
        ::first-line

        */

        /* Review Task: style the first letter of each paragraph with .... */
        p::first-letter {
            font-weight: bold;
            font-style: italic;
        }

        /*
    - Pseudo Class: acts like an extra value for a class attribute

    We will work on these 4 main types of "Pseudo Class":
    :link ==> the normal link inside <a> element (default style: blue color with underline)
    :visited ==> the visited or the clicked links (After the user clicked the link)
    :hover ==> when we hover the mouse over the link
    :active ==> when we click the link (The moment when we click/hold the mouse button on the link)

    To use them all, they should appear in the following sequence:
    Link Visited Hover Active => LoVe HAte

    NOTE:
    - We can also add :focus to be used with the Keyboard TAB key for Accessibility
    - We should add it between LoVe and HAte:
    :link
    :visited
    :focus
    :hover
    :active
    */

        /*
    let's style the <a> elements inside our <nav> element which is inside the <header> element
    in other word, style the a element which is the descendant of nav which is the descendant of header
    header => nav => a

    Descendant Selector (Page 238 table):
    style any <a> element inside the <nav> which is inside the header


    my basic/initial selector: header nav a

    we will apply the four types of "Pseudo Classes" on our selector "header nav a"
    */

        /* The default normal link: */
        header nav a:link {
            /* remove the default underline */
            text-decoration: none;

            /* override the default blue color */
            color: rgb(129, 6, 6);

            /*
            make the main nav stands out by using Capital letters
            */
            text-transform: uppercase;
        }

        /* The already clicked link (visited): */
        header nav a:visited {
            /* The default color for any visited link is purple */
            color: rgb(151, 150, 150);
        }

        /* The hover: on mouse hovering/moving */
        header nav a:hover {
            color: rgb(248, 152, 8);
        }


        /* The active: on mouse click */
        header nav a:active {
            color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
        }

        /* More examples of using Pseudo Element  */
        p::before {
            content: "Paragraph: ";
